# Lyo Validation library

The library validates RDF resources against constraints defined either as [`SHACL`](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) or [`OSLC Resource Shapes`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-core/oslc-core/v3.0/cs01/part6-resource-shape/oslc-core-v3.0-cs01-part6-resource-shape.html).

## Getting started

Add the following repository to your POM file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>lyo-releases</id>
        <name>Eclipse Lyo Releases</name>
        <url>https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/lyo-releases/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Now add a dependency for the library:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.lyo</groupId>
    <artifactId>lyo-validation</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0.M3</version>
</dependency>
```

Start by reading the library's main interface class [`Validator`](http://download.eclipse.org/lyo/docs/validation/2.3.0.M3/org/eclipse/lyo/validation/Validator.html) on Javadoc.

You can also review the library's [`unit test cases`](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo-validation/tree/master/src/test/java/org/eclipse/lyo/validation) that shows how to use this interface. 

Finally, you can review the [`sample application`](https://github.com/eclipse/lyo-validation/blob/master/src/test/java/org/eclipse/lyo/validation/ValidationExample.java), which shows 3 validation examples, where:

* an RDF resource (jena model) is validated against a SHACL shape (another jena model).
* An java object (representing an RDF resource) is validated against SHACL annotations defined on its Java class.
* An java object (representing an RDF resource) is validated against OSLC annotations defined on its Java class.
